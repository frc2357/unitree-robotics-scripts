 @mainpage mmWave DFP 3.x (Device Firmware Package)

 \section dfp_intro_sec Introduction

mmWave DFP 3.x is a Device Firmware Package for TI’s low end platform mmWave RF transceiver devices. mmWave DFP is collection of foundational API software, firmware, drivers, and ROM components associated with mmWave devices. mmWave DFP provides seamless control and configuration of Radar Frontend Controller Sub System (FECSS) in real-time either from an external host device in case of Front End (FE) mmWave sensors or from integrated M4 APPSS core in case of SOC. \n

The mmWave DFP is responsible to provide API function calls to all RF front end related functionalities and configurations; using these APIs application can calibrate the RF device, generate radar waveforms and get functional safety monitoring results from FECSS. These APIs enables the RF transceiver to be self-contained and capable of adapting itself to dynamic conditions, such as temperature changes, functional safety capable and minimize the RF related knowledge/dependencies and algoritms run part of application software. \n

TI low cost and low power, low end mmWave radar products are highly-integrated 60GHz and 77GHz CMOS millimeter wave devices for Automotive and Industrial applications. The device integrated with all of the RF and Analog functionality, including VCO, PLL, PA, LNA, Mixer and ADC for multiple TX/RX channels into a single chip in a low power digital architecture. \n
 -# The xWRL6432 is a 60GHz mmwave radar-on-a-chip (SOC) device, which includes 3 receive channels

| Component       | Description |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| FECSS Library   | The FECSS open-source ROM/RAM drivers library is responsible for management and operation of the Radar sensor frontend functions and waveform generation in the device. The mWaveLink APIs internally call these FECSSLib driver APIs to configure the FECSS  |
| RFS             | The ROM/patch binary is responsible for executing pre defined TI device specific RF analog sequences, the dedicated RF scripter M3 core runs these sequence based on commands from FECSS library or mmWaveLink. The patch file is loaded in the device patch RAM during boot which is used to implement bug fixes and minor feature additions in RF Scriptor ROM  |
| mmWaveLink      | This is an open-source, OS and device agnostic API functions for user control  and configuration of the RF analog FECSS in the device.  The mmwaveLink is the user communication API to the FECSS. The mmWaveLink layer can be integrated with SDK(SoC)/External Host (Frontend) |

 \subsection dfp_fecssLib_subsec FECSS Library

TI low end mmWave radar device includes a radar front end or FECSS (Radar Frontend ControllerSub System), which  is responsible for configuring the RF/Analog and digital front-end for sensor functionality for waveform generation, calibration and functional safety monitoring based on driver API calls. FECSSLib is responsible to provide these driver API calls to mmWaveLink. \n

TI FECSS is a open subsystem whose digital blocks can be configurable using FECSSLib drivers. FECSS has a closed RF Front End Scripter M3 core (RFS), which is responsible to run Analog Front End (AFE) sequences based on commands from FECSS library. mmWaveLink APIs calls FECSSLib drivers to configure the FECSS.

### FECSS Library Block Diagram
 @image html FecssLib.png "mmWave FECSSLib Block Diagram"

### FECSS Library ROM/Patch Options
The FECSS drivers are open source software, TI is providing option either to use ROM/patch library driver functions or RAM functions in library generation build options. In ES1.0 mmwave silicon, the FECSSLib ROM is not available and user has to link 'fecss_rom_m4.lib' by default and it is a static RAM library. Refer \ref fecsslib_build_sec for more details on ROM and patch library build options.

### FECSS Library Driver APIs
The FECSS library provides multiple low level driver APIs to configure/control the FECSS. Refer below section to know more about FECSSLib driver modules and APIs.
 - \ref fecsslib_api_sec
.
Refer below sections for more details on FECSSLib
 - \ref fecsslib_interface_sec
 - \ref fecsslib_build_sec
.
 \subsection dfp_rfs_subsec RFS Firmware
RF Front End Scripter (RFS) is a closed subsystem, which has cortex M3 core responsible to run set of analog and digital configuration sequences and algoritms related to analog power domains, clocks, runtime sensor configurations, calibrations and functional analog safety monitors. \n
RFS has a command interface mailbox for IPC, a standard TI internal protocol is used to communicate with RFS from FECSSLib. The RFS firmware algorithms are functional safety compliance TI proprietary libraries and TI provides binary image part of this DFP package. The 'rfsfirmware' folder in DFP package contains this binary image.

### RFS Block Diagram
 @image html RFS.png "mmWave RF Front End Scripter Block Diagram"

### RFS - FECSSLib IPC
A mailbox IPC interface is used to communicate between RFS and FECSSLib. The FECSS library provides multiple low level driver APIs to construct and invoke RFS commands. Refer below section to know more about RFS commands and protocol details.
 - \ref fecsslib_rfs_sec
.
 \subsection dfp_mmwl_subsec mmWaveLink

mmWaveLink (also called RadarLink) Library is a top most layer in DFP, which provides software abstraction API function calls to FECSS. mmWaveLink 3.x APIs are a simple wrapper API functions, which calls FECSSLib driver api functions to service the API called by application. \n

Highlights of mmWaveLink Library Framework:
 - A link between application and FECSS.
 - Provides low level APIs to configure the FECSS and handles the communication with the front
   end.
 - Platform and OS independent which means it can be ported into any processor which provides
   communication interface such as SPI/Register and basic OS/non-OS routines. The mmWaveLink framework can also run in single and multi threaded environment.
 - Can be integrated into TI mmWave SDK or customer application and runs on APPSS cortex M4F   processor in xWR6432 and xWR1432 SOC devices.
 - It can run on any external HOST processor which controls TI mmWave Front End (FE) devices (xWR6131 FE device).
